# A Pokedex with a Pokegame
### Some fun with React Hooks and Simple CSS animation
***

Starting with a simple project that combined some API work with updated React work (trying to use maily functional components), I started adding more functionality and more css. As things stand once the "hands" of pokemon are determined, the hand with the highest exp total wins. I would eventually like this be a playable game where players can actually take actions that may help them win. For the time being the winning hand is determined almost as soon as the API is finished and on it's way to being rendered.

This app features React as it was around August 2020, and some practice CSS animations.

### Plans For the Future
- [ ] Add gameplay: each player can reroll one pokemon to try and get a higher exp pokemon.
- [ ] Skip button for rerolls.
- [ ] Update fonts.
- [ ] Animate text.
- [ ] Add game explanation modal.
- [ ] Make it possible for the players to choose how many pokemon per hand.
- [ ] Players can choose number of rerolls.
- [ ] Add tests!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
